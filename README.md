This portfolio website showcases my skills and projects as a web developer. The website is built using React.

## First Part with ThreeJS

The First part of the website uses the ThreeJS library to create interactive graphics and animations. ThreeJS is a powerful and flexible library for creating 3D graphics and animations in the browser. By using ThreeJS, I was able to bring my portfolio to life and showcase my skills in a unique and engaging way.

## About Me

The "About Me" section provides an overview of my journey in web development, including my skills, experience, and interests. The section also features CSS animation on scroll, adding a dynamic and interactive touch to the website.

## Project Carrousel

The project carrousel showcases a list of my projects, with a thumbnail image, a short description, and buttons for the GitHub repository and live demo. This section allows visitors to see my work and learn more about my projects.

## Contact Information

The website features a section for my contact information, including links to my Twitter, Discord, GitHub, and email. If you would like to get in touch, this section provides all the information you need to get in touch with me.
